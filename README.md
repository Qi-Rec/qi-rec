## Frontend (Artemii Kister)

The frontend component of the Qi-Rec system provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the song recommendation engine. Built with modern web technologies, it ensures a seamless experience for users to discover new music based on their current playlists.

### Features

- User Interface: A clean and intuitive design for users to easily input their playlists and view song recommendations.
- Interactive Elements: Dynamic elements that enhance user interaction, such as real-time search and playlist management.

### Technologies

- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- JavaScript: To handle user interactions and communicate with the backend API.
- Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, ensuring a dynamic and responsive application.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API, facilitating seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend.


### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
   
3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
   
### Running the Frontend

4. To start the development server and run the frontend application, use the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
   

This will launch the application on http://localhost:8080, where you can interact with the Qi-Rec systemâ€™s user interface.

### Built With

- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Axios

By following these instructions, you will be able to set up and run the frontend part of the Qi-Rec project, providing a user-friendly interface for song recommendations.

## Backend (Dmitry Krasnoyarov)

## ML + MLOps (Arman Tovmasian)

ML Core is a machine learning project that uses Python and the FastAPI framework. It is designed to provide a RESTful API for song recommendation based on a given playlist.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python
- pip

### Installing

```Future```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /predict`: Predicts the next song based on the given playlist. The request body should be a JSON object that matches the `Playlist` schema. The response will be a `SongResponse` object.

- `POST /commit_model`: Commits a new version of the song recommender model straight into the MLFlow registry. The response will be a JSON object with a message indicating the success of the operation.

## Versioning

The project uses MLflow for versioning the machine learning models. The `Versioner` class in `ml/versioning/versioning.py` is responsible for committing new versions of the model.

## Retraining

The project uses Apache Airflow for scheduled retraining, if there's some changes in original dataset
